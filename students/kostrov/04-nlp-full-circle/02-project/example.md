The breath of <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">man</mark> and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">father</mark> had the <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">man</mark> cut down from the wall and dragged before them. <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">Robb</mark> and <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon</mark> sat tall and still on their horses, with <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark> between them on <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">his</mark> pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">he</mark>'d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.
<mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark>'s <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">father</mark> sat solemnly on <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">His</mark> closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">him</mark> look older than <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> thirty-five years. <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">He</mark> had a grim cast to <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> grey eyes this day, and <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">he</mark> seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">He</mark> had taken off Father's face, <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark> thought, and donned the face of <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">Lord Stark</mark> of Winterfell.
There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark> could not recall much of what had been said. Finally <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">his</mark> lord <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">father</mark> gave a command, and two of <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> guardsmen dragged the ragged <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">man</mark> to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">his</mark> head down onto the hard black wood. Lord <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">Eddard Stark</mark> dismounted and <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> ward <mark id="theon" style="background-color:#48A9A6">Theon Greyjoy</mark> brought forth the sword. "Ice," that sword was called. It was as wide across as a <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">man</mark>'s hand, and taller even than <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">Robb</mark>. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.
<mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">His</mark> <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">father</mark> peeled off <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> gloves and handed them to <mark id="jory" style="background-color:#FFAD05">Jory Cassel</mark>, the captain of <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> household guard. <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">He</mark> took hold of Ice with both hands and said, "In the name of <mark id="robert" style="background-color:#FCFF4B">Robert</mark> of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">Eddard</mark> of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">I</mark> do sentence you to die." <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">He</mark> lifted the greatsword high above <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">his</mark> head.
<mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark>'s bastard brother <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon Snow</mark> moved closer. "Keep the pony well in hand," <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">he</mark> whispered. "And don't look away. <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">Father</mark> will know if <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">you</mark> do."
<mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark> kept <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">his</mark> pony well in hand, and did not look away.
<mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">His</mark> <mark id="ned" style="background-color:#CEEC97">father</mark> took off the <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">man</mark>'s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark> could not take <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">his</mark> eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.
The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near <mark id="theon" style="background-color:#48A9A6">Greyjoy</mark>'s feet. <mark id="theon" style="background-color:#48A9A6">Theon</mark> was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. <mark id="theon" style="background-color:#48A9A6">He</mark> laughed, put <mark id="theon" style="background-color:#48A9A6">his</mark> boot on the head, and kicked it away.
"Ass," <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon</mark> muttered, low enough so <mark id="theon" style="background-color:#48A9A6">Greyjoy</mark> did not hear. <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">He</mark> put a hand on <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark>'s shoulder, and <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark> looked over at <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">his</mark> bastard brother. "<mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">You</mark> did well," <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon</mark> told <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">him</mark> solemnly. <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon</mark> was fourteen, an old hand at justice.
It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">Bran</mark> rode with <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">his</mark> brothers, well ahead of the main party, <mark id="bran" style="background-color:#EB8258">his</mark> pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.
"The <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">deserter</mark> died bravely," <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">Robb</mark> said. <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">He</mark> was big and broad and growing every day, with <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">his</mark> mother's coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. "<mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">He</mark> had courage, at the least."
"No," <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon Snow</mark> said quietly. "It was not courage. <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">This one</mark> was dead of fear. <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">You</mark> could see it in <mark id="deserter" style="background-color:#5995ED">his</mark> eyes, <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">Stark</mark>." <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon</mark>'s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">He</mark> was of an age with <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">Robb</mark>, but they did not look alike. <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">Jon</mark> was slender where <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">Robb</mark> was muscular, dark where <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">Robb</mark> was fair, graceful and quick where <mark id="jon" style="background-color:#6689A1">his</mark> <mark id="robb" style="background-color:#D7B377">half brother</mark> was strong and fast.
