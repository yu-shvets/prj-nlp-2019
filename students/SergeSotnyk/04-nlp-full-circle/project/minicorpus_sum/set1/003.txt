Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim
Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.
"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets," said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case.
