@Digest:
Ad sales boost Time Warner profit
The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales.
Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.
Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations.
It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.
