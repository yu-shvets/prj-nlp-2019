High fuel prices hit BA's profits
To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.
Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m.
Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as "pretty modest".
"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong," he said.
