Fifteen people were injured, but none of the injuries was critical, according to Madison County Memorial Hospital administrator Jeannie Baker.
Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes blown apart by the tornado, and four other houses were seriously damaged as well, said Madison County Civil Defense Director Bernard Wilson.
Trees, roofs and mobile homes were damaged, and at least six other injuries were reported.
Madison, a town of about 3,500 people, is the county seat of Madison County, a thinly populated tobacco growing area of piney woods, rolling hills and swamps on the border with Georgia.
The twister blew away several homes, blew the roof off a nearby church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, Peavy said.
As far as his office knew, all the damage was from one tornado, Peavy said.
Three homes and a trailer were destroyed and five homes seriously damaged, he said, and two people were slightly injured.
Hail the size of golf balls and damaging winds hit Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
Elsewhere in Georgia, trees and power lines were reported blown down, a barn was reported destroyed and a tin roof was blown off an old building.
In the eastern Georgia's Bulloch County, six mobile homes and one house were heavily damaged shortly after dawn today, but no injuries were reported, the weather service said.
