Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused the United States of threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinian guerrillas attack American targets.
The State Department said in Washington that it had received reports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S. involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's second in command.
Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, claimed the threat to kill PLO officials was made in a U.S. government document the PLO obtained from an Arab government.
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy denied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLO officials.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States has been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries about possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
We would hold the PLO responsible for any such attacks.'' Arafat said the document ``reveals the U.S. administration is planning, in full cooperation with the Israelis, to conduct a crusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the PLO for them.
