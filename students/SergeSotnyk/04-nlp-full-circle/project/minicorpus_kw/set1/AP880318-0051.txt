Thousands Mark Total Eclipse With Prayers, Dancing and Drum-Beating
Thousands of peole prayed, cheered, danced, beat drums and observed other traditions today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of Indonesia and the southern Philippines.
Scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the Gulf of Alaska.
Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia, Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the eclipse.
Richard Fisher of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colo., said that despite scattered clouds, scientists were confident they had taken useful pictures of the eclipse.
Clouds blocked the first moments of the eclipse in General Santos City.
Many other Filipinos marked the eclipse by going to church.
Church bells in Davao tolled while police and civilians set off firecrackers and fired weapons in the air to mark the eclipse.
