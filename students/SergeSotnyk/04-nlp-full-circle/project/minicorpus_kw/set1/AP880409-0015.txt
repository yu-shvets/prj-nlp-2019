Increase In Atlantic Hurricanes Predicted
A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas, but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten populated areas.
The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons.
Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred.
