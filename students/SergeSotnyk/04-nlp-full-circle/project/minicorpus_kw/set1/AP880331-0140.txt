Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from April through June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in the nation's heartland.
In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoes occur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the most unstable, that average increases to about 36.
``A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm.
One is to know the difference between the tornado watches and tornado warnings issued by the weather service.
Take cover immediately and don't go outside, but if you are in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in the nearest ditch or depression.
McIntyre noted that most fatalities in a tornado are from flying debris, so ``we tell people to squat down, cover their heads and present a low profile.'' James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for Disaster Research at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly try to outrun tornadoes in their cars.
