#Ukrainian language punctuation checking

##Goal
The project is more of exploratory nature than designed for practical and specific use cases.
The main goals are to:
+ find regularities of Ukrainian spelling that could be caught by neural network
+ understand what specific words or/and word's features influenced NN decisions
    
Checker would consist of several parts:
+ Check if sentence in general is correct or not
+ Restore missing punctuation or remove redundant punctuation by predicting punctuation after each sign:
    {comma, colon, semicolon, dash, none}
+ Restore missing ? and ! signs in the end of sentence

Sentence end finding(missing dot restoration) is not included as a task for the project, but partially would be solved while splitting corpus by sentences for training (based on some rules).

##Training dataset:
As checker would be for general purpose and not designed for any specific use like sms, chat messages or business correspondence - Ukrainian Wikipedia corpus will be used as source of truth.
+ All texts from wiki are considered as correct examples.
+ Negative examples will be generated by deletion and by random adding commas.
+ For ?! restoration data will be generate by replacing ?! with dot

##Validation dataset:
For validation up to 10% of wikipedia would be used

##Test dataset:
For final testing corpus with real user's errors should be used (at least 300 sentences).
Possible sources of such errors are:
+ Wikipedia revisions
+ Forums
+ Friends

Data for test dataset will be checked manually


##Proposed architecture:
Bi-RNN will be used to derive regularities from corpus.
###Input
+ State 1 - word embeddings wor each word in sentence
+ Stage 2 - word embeddings with POS tag
+ Stage 3 - more feature would added - TBD later ðŸ¤”
